INTRODUCTION
============

	 This simple MIPS simulator inputs "dimage.bin" and "iimage.bin"
	and outputs "snapshot.rpt" and "error_dump.rpt" where "dimage.bin" is the binary code of data of 1KB in little-endian,  "iimage.bin" is the binary code of instructions of 1KB in little-endian, "snapshot.rpt" is the result of simulating, and "error_dump.rpt" contains the errors.(if occurred)

	 This simple MIPS simulator is a simpler version than the real one.
	We simulate some MIPS instructions (all 32-bit) on this simulator including following opcodes:
	 1. R-type: 
	 	"add", "sub", "and", "or", "xor", "nor", "nand", "slt",
		"sll", "srl", "sra", "jr".
	 2. I-type: 
	 	"addi", "lw", "lh", "lhu", "lb", "lbu", "sw", "sh",
		"sb", "lui", "andi", "ori", "nori", "slti", "beq", "bne".
	 3. J-type:
	 	"j", "jal".
	 4. S-type:
	 	"halt".
	 Note that we don't simulate ALL MIPS instructions, just all above.
	 (No floating point instructions, no "sltiu", and so on.)

	 We also handle some errors including following:
	  1. Binary files cannot be read in. (terminate)
	  2. Cannot allocate dynamic memory. (terminate)
	  3. Write $0 error in cycle. 
	  	 (skip this cycle and continue to simulate)
	  4. Number overflow in cycle.
	     (Still simulate)
	  5. Address overflow in cycle. (terminate)
	  6. Misalignment error in cycle. (terminate)
	 If any one of all above errors occur we will warn you.( 1~2 on screen, 3~6 in error_dump.rpt)

USING METHOD
============

	 Untar the "MIPS32_single_cycle_simulator.tar.gz" in your environment, 
	make, and then execute.
	 If you are in Unix or Cygwin this kind of Unix like environment
	in Windows, type the following commands:

	% tar zxvf MIPS32_single_cycle_simulator.tar.gz
	% cd MIPS32_single_cycle_simulator/simulator
	% make
	% ./single_cycle
	(or "%./single_cycle.exe" in some environments)

	and it will generate "snapshot.rpt" and  "error_dump.rpt".
	Note that you should have the "dimage.bin" and "iimage.bin" in the same directory as your "single_cycle".

	 As I said, your "dimage.bin" and "iimage.bin" are the binary code 
	of data and instructions of 1KB in little-endian.
	 The format of "dimage.bin" should be the order of following:

				the starting address of $sp (4 Bytes) --> 
				the amount of words of following data (4 Bytes) --> 
				the body of data (n bytes)
	 
	 The format of "iimage.bin" should be the order of following:

				the starting address of PC (4 Bytes) --> 
		the amount of words of following instructions (4 Bytes) --> 
				the body of instructions (n bytes)
	 
	 There are some test cases in the folder "testcase" tou can try.
	 You can type "diff snapshot.rpt ~/Correct/snapshot.rpt" to see if 
	they are identical. (where "~/Correct/snapshot.rpt" is the path of the correct result simulated by TAs golden simulator) 
	
	Note: If you want to see every words in hex IR, I have put the testing "fprintf" or "printf" in some the functions in .c file, you can use it just by deleting the comment notation "/*" "*/", and then you can compare it if it's your ideal result.

BUGS
====
		
	 I have checked it detailedly, so it should have had bare bugs. 
	However, if you find some bugs, then I sincerely hope you can contact me by FB ,or e-mail me, or call me directly. Thanks for you help!

FAQs
====

	Q: What is this software used for?
	 A: A MIPS simulator which simulates the MIPS format machine codes and shoe its result.
	
	Q: What is MIPS and what is machine language?
	 A: Look it up in your textbook or google it.
	
	Q: Why can't I "make"?
	 A: You should have some related compiler tools in your system first, like gcc. (GNU C compiler). Also, you should have had "make" utility in your environment.
	
	Q: Why I typed "./a.out" or "./a.exe" but it shows me an error?
	 A: We generate the executable file that names "single_cycle", so you should key in "single_cycle" instead of "./a.out" or "./a.exe".
	
	Q: Why I typed "single_cycle" but still have error?
	 A: You may try to type "./single_cycle".
	
	Q: Why I typed "cat" to see "dimage.bin" and "iimage.bin" but what I see is a garbled text?
	 A: It's normal, since ".bin" file contains binary data, 
	 and you should type "xxd image.bin" or "hexdump image.bin" or "vim –b image.bin" and in Vim, type ":%!xxd". (if you haven't had "xxd" or "hexdump" utility or "Vim editor" yet, please install them first)
	
	Q: How do I verify if the result is correct?
	 A: Do "diff" with the result from the correct one.
	
	Q: Ok, I do it right, and then?
	 A: Congratulations! You made it. If you like it, sincerely please to donate or I won't have enough money to rent a small little room for myself to live in next semester. ~TAT~ 
	
	If you have other problems, just contact me ASAP and I will answer you.^^
