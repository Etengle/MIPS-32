INTRODUCTION
============

	 	This pipelined MIPS simulator inputs "dimage.bin" and "iimage.bin"
	and outputs "snapshot.rpt" and "error_dump.rpt" where "dimage.bin" is the binary code of data of 1KB in little-endian,  "iimage.bin" is the binary code of instructions of 1KB in little-endian, "snapshot.rpt" is the result of simulating, and "error_dump.rpt" contains the errors.(if occurred)

	 	Unlike last one (Simple MIPS simulator), which is basically single cycle 
	simulation, this pipelined MIPS simulator is pipelined simulation.
	 	The difference between single cycle and pipeline is that pipeline has 5 stages
	(IF -> ID -> EXE -> DM -> WB) in each cycle, which is faster but more complicated.
	 	This pipelined MIPS simulator is a simpler version than the real one.
	We simulate some MIPS instructions (all 32-bit) on this simulator including following opcodes:
	 1. R-type: 
	 	"add", "sub", "and", "or", "xor", "nor", "nand", "slt",
		"sll", "srl", "sra", "jr".
	 2. I-type: 
	 	"addi", "lw", "lh", "lhu", "lb", "lbu", "sw", "sh",
		"sb", "lui", "andi", "ori", "nori", "slti", "beq", "bne".
	 3. J-type:
	 	"j", "jal".
	 4. S-type:
	 	"halt".
	 Note that we don't simulate ALL MIPS instructions, just all above.
	 (No floating point instructions, no "sltiu", and so forth.)

	 We realized some technique on this one, including:
	  1. Stall detection
	  2. Forwarding (or bypassing) detection
	  3. flush detection
	 But no branch prediction.

	 We also handle some errors including following:
	  1. Binary files cannot be read in. (terminate)
	  2. Cannot allocate dynamic memory. (terminate)
	  3. Write $0 error in cycle. 
	  	 (skip this cycle and continue to simulate)
	  4. Number overflow in cycle.
	     (Still simulate)
	  5. D/I-Memory address overflow in cycle. (terminate)
	  6. D/I-Memory misalignment error in cycle. (terminate)
	 If any one of all above errors occur we will warn you. (1~2 on screen, 3~6 in error_dump.rpt)

USING METHOD
============

	 	Untar the "archi01.tar.gz" in your environment, make, and then 
	execute.
	 	If you are in Unix or Cygwin this kind of Unix like environment
	in Windows, type the following commands:

	% tar zxvf archi01.tar.gz
	% cd archi01/simulator
	% make
	% ./pipeline
	(or "%./pipeline.exe" in some environments like Windows)

	and it will generate "snapshot.rpt" and  "error_dump.rpt".
	Note that you should have the "dimage.bin" and "iimage.bin" in the same directory as your "pipeline".

		There are some test cases in the folder "testcase" you can try.
	 	You can type "diff snapshot.rpt ~/Correct/snapshot.rpt" to see if 
	they are identical. (where "~/Correct/snapshot.rpt" is the path of the correct result simulated by TAs golden simulator) 

INPUT FORMAT
============
	 	As I said, your "dimage.bin" and "iimage.bin" are the binary code 
	of data and instructions of 1KB in little-endian.
	 	The format of "dimage.bin" should be the order of following:

				the starting address of $sp (4 Bytes) --> 
				the amount of words of following data (4 Bytes) --> 
				the body of data (n bytes)
	 
	 The format of "iimage.bin" should be the order of following:

				the starting address of PC (4 Bytes) --> 
				the amount of words of following instructions (4 Bytes) --> 
				the body of instructions (n bytes)
	 
OUTPUT FORMAT
============
	
	snapshot.rpt:

		Show the state of registers after last cycle be done and what the next instruction will be execute 
	in every stages of every cycle.

	e.g.
					cycle 44
					$00: 0x00000000
					$01: 0x00000400
					$02: 0xFFFFABCD
					$03: 0xCDCDABCD
					$04: 0xCD000000
					$05: 0xCD00ABCD
					$06: 0xFFFFABCD
					$07: 0x0000ABCD
					$08: 0xABCD0000
					$09: 0x00CD0000
					$10: 0xFFFF8000
					$11: 0x00000000
					$12: 0x00000000
					$13: 0x00000000
					$14: 0x000000CD
					$15: 0xFFFFFFCD
					$16: 0x00000000
					$17: 0x00000000
					$18: 0x00000000
					$19: 0x00000000
					$20: 0x00000000
					$21: 0x00000000
					$22: 0x00000000
					$23: 0x00000000
					$24: 0x00000000
					$25: 0x00000000
					$26: 0x00000000
					$27: 0x00000000
					$28: 0x00000000
					$29: 0x00000000
					$30: 0x00000000
					$31: 0x00000000
					PC: 0x000000A8
					IF: 0x214A0007 to_be_flushed
					ID: BNE fwd_EX-DM_rt_$10
					EX: SLL fwd_DM-WB_rt_$11
					DM: AND
					WB: ADDI

	error_dump.rpt:

		Show the errors found in every cycle.

	e.g.
					Write $0 error in cycle: 353
					Address overflow in cycle: 353
					Misalignment error in cycle: 353
					Number overflow in cycle: 353

BUGS
====
		
	 	I have checked it detailedly, so it should have had bare bugs. 
	However, if you find some bugs, then I sincerely hope you can contact me by FB ,or e-mail me, or call me directly. Thanks for you help!

FAQs
====

	Q: What is this software used for?
	 A: A MIPS simulator which simulates the MIPS format machine codes and shoe its result.
	
	Q: What is MIPS and what is machine language?
	 A: Look it up in your textbook or google it.
	
	Q: Why can't I "make"?
	 A: You should have some related compiler tools in your system first, like gcc. (GNU C compiler). Also, you should have had "make" utility in your environment.
	
	Q: Why I typed "./a.out" or "./a.exe" but it shows me an error?
	 A: We generate the executable file that names "pipeline", so you should key in "pipeline" instead of "./a.out" or "./a.exe".
	
	Q: Why I typed "pipeline" but still have error?
	 A: You may try to type "./pipeline".
	
	Q: Why I typed "cat" to see "dimage.bin" and "iimage.bin" but what I see is a garbled text?
	 A: It's normal, since ".bin" file contains binary data, 
	 and you should type "xxd image.bin" or "hexdump image.bin" or "vim â€“b image.bin" and in Vim, type ":%!xxd". (if you haven't had "xxd" or "hexdump" utility or "Vim editor" yet, please install them first)
	
	Q: How do I verify if the result is correct?
	 A: Do "diff" with the result from the correct one.
	
	Q: Ok, I do it right, and then?
	 A: Congratulations! You made it. If you like it, sincerely please to donate or I won't have enough money to rent a small little room for myself to live in next semester. ~TAT~ 
	
	If you have other problems, just contact me ASAP and I will answer you.^^
